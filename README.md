Our goal is to implement the Linux operating systemon an embedded target, while exploring in detail the boot mechanisms, from bootloader
loading to application level. We will also study the various elements required in this
process, such as the kernel, device tree, initial file system, root file system, as well as
the initialization process. Finally, we will explore device drivers and implement one
on our embedded Linux system.
